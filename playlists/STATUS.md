## A&E and A+E Networks channels (`playlists/AE_Channels.m3u`)

- **Confirmed working:** 59 / 71 unique links (dead: 9, unverified: 3)

## Reference-source checks (not automatically imported)

| Reference | Check | Channels seen | Playlist links | Ingest status | Note |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| eja.tv | reachable | - | 0 | not_imported | The site is checked for reachability only. No static M3U export was verified; it is not scraped/imported as channels. Configure EJA_M3U_URL only if you have an authorized direct playlist URL. |
| StepDaddyLiveHD | reachable | - | 0 | no_static_playlist | Repository tree is checked for static M3U files. The project describes a self-hosted proxy whose playlist is generated at an instance URL; configure STEPDADDYLIVEHD_PLAYLIST_URL to check a hosted instance. (repository is archived) |
| dlive.sx | reachable | 899 | 0 | player_pages_only | DaddyLiveHD 24/7 channel index. The page lists channels as HTML player pages (/stream/stream-<id>.php) whose stream address is resolved by JavaScript at run time, and its channels/schedule API needs a key issued by the operator, so the site publishes no static playlist. The catalogue is counted for visibility only and no channel is imported. Set DLIVE_M3U_URL to an authorized direct playlist URL - for example one generated by a self-hosted proxy - to import it and have every link checked like any other source. |
